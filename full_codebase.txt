---

## 🔧 Key Components

### 1. Synthetic Enterprise Environment — ApexGrid Systems

ApexGrid is a fictional mid-to-large hybrid enterprise operating across SaaS, energy utilities, industrial IoT, and cybersecurity.

Products:

- **HelioCloud** — SaaS observability & APM  
- **GridSense** — energy/utility IoT monitoring  
- **LineaOps** — manufacturing & robotics telemetry  
- **VaultShield** — identity & security analytics  

The repository includes documentation describing:

- the product suite  
- support ticket taxonomy  
- operational challenges  
- customer tiers and regions  
- realistic metadata schema  

This serves as the canonical foundation for all synthetic data and ML pipelines.

---

### 2. Synthetic Data Generation (Local LLM via Ollama)

The `/synthetic` module uses local LLMs (e.g. Qwen, LLaMA via **Ollama**) to generate thousands of fully synthetic support tickets, each including:

- product, category, subcategory  
- severity and customer tier  
- environment and region  
- timestamp  
- summary and full description  
- optional LLM-generated topics  

All data is:

- fictional and non-identifying  
- free from real PII or company names  
- consistent with the ApexGrid taxonomy  

Main pieces:

- `synthetic/generate_tickets_ollama.py`  
- prompt templates per product  
- sample batches for inspection and testing  

---

### 3. Embedding & Clustering Pipeline

Located in `/models/embed` and `/models/cluster`, this pipeline transforms synthetic text into high-dimensional vectors using local embedding models such as:

- `mxbai-embed-large`  
- `nomic-embed-text`  

It then applies:

- UMAP / t-SNE / PaCMAP for 2D/3D manifolds  
- HDBSCAN or similar algorithms for semantic clustering  
- duplicate/near-duplicate detection  
- cluster labeling and keyword extraction  

Outputs include:

- `ticket_points.js` for WebGL visualizations  
- `embeddings.npy`  
- `cluster_labels.npy`  

---

### 4. Model Evaluation / Health Metrics

The `/models/eval` module provides metrics to characterize the embedding and clustering quality, such as:

- silhouette scores  
- cluster cohesion and separation  
- cluster stability  
- topic entropy  
- severity and category distributions  
- drift over time  
- precision@k for duplicate retrieval  
- cluster purity (when ground-truth labels are used)  

Aggregated outputs are written to:

- `model_health.json`  
- JavaScript payloads consumed by the web UI  

---

### 5. Interactive Web Visualization (WebGL + Charts)

The `/web` folder contains a standalone visualization layer built with:

- **Three.js** for 3D point clouds  
- **TailwindCSS** for styling  
- **Chart.js** for charts  
- lightweight **Vue.js** state management  

Features:

- 3D embedding view of support tickets  
- coloring by category, product, or severity  
- hover tooltips for representative samples  
- charts for category distribution, severity mix, and volume over time  
- model-health and cluster-quality summaries  

This layer can be embedded into websites or used standalone for live demos.

## 6. Visualization & Interaction Layer

**Primary Role:** Present the ML outputs in a visually compelling, interactive interface suitable for:

* client demos
* website sections
* POCs
* workshops

**Key Components:**

* `web/index.html`

  * Static HTML entrypoint
  * Loads:

    * Three.js
    * TailwindCSS
    * Chart.js
    * Vue.js (CDN)
    * `web/data/ticket_points.js`
    * `web/data/ticket_summary.js`

* `web/js/embedding_viz.js`

  * Creates a Three.js scene
  * Plots tickets as 3D points
  * Colors points by category, product, or severity
  * Adds interaction (hover info, rotation, zoom)

* `web/js/charts.js`

  * Uses Chart.js to render:

    * severity distributions
    * category counts
    * product mix
    * cluster metrics

* `web/js/tabs.js`

  * Simple tab or mode switching between:

    * 3D embedding
    * model health view
    * distributions
    * cluster insight panels

Deployment is as simple as serving `web/` via a static HTTP server.

---

## 7. Deployment & Runtime Environments

### 7.1 Local Development

Typical local stack:

* OS: Windows / macOS / Linux
* Python virtual environment
* Ollama running locally
* Static HTTP server for the `web` folder

Example commands:

```bash
# 1. Generate synthetic data
python synthetic/generate_tickets_ollama.py

# 2. Run embedding pipeline
python models/embed/compute_embeddings.py
python models/cluster/cluster_umap_hdbscan.py
python models/eval/embedding_health.py

# 3. Serve the web app
cd web
python -m http.server 3000
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:3000`.

### 7.2 Optional Containerization

For portability, components can be containerized:

* Container 1: Python ML stack + Ollama client
* Container 2: Ollama server with models
* Container 3: Static web server (nginx or similar)

This is not mandatory for demos but can support more advanced environments.

---

## 8. Security & Privacy Considerations

The architecture is intentionally designed so that:

* **All data is synthetic.**

  * No real customers, log lines, or metrics are used.
* **LLMs run locally via Ollama.**

  * No external calls are required.
* **No external API keys are needed** for core functionality.
* **No personal identifiers** should appear in generated text:

  * Enforced via prompting + validation.

This makes the system safe to use in:

* public talks
* recorded demos
* shared repositories
* client-facing materials (with clear “synthetic data” disclaimer)

---

## 9. Extensibility

The architecture is modular. Future extensions can sit naturally alongside existing layers.

### 9.1 Additional Data Modalities

* IoT telemetry time-series for GridSense / LineaOps
* synthetic identity access logs for VaultShield
* synthetic application traces and metrics for HelioCloud
* synthetic billing or usage data for financial modeling

These can feed:

* anomaly detection models
* forecasting services
* multi-modal embeddings

### 9.2 Agent & API Layer

A minimal API (e.g., FastAPI/Flask) can sit between ML artifacts and the UI:

* New ticket → embed → nearest neighbors → triage suggestion
* Cluster exploration → fetch representative tickets → LLM summary
* Incident detection → highlight clusters with recent spikes

This layer would:

```text
[Frontend] ⇄ [API: triage, search, incident] ⇄ [Embeddings + Metadata]
```

### 9.3 Integration with Other Tools

The artifacts can be used in:

* notebooks (exploration, teaching)
* slide decks (screenshots of 3D embeddings & charts)
* external dashboards (e.g., Grafana, Superset)
* other web experiences

---

## 10. Summary

The Qognus Demo Platform architecture:

* starts with **synthetic ApexGrid support tickets**, generated via local LLMs
* flows through an **ML pipeline** producing embeddings, projections, clusters, and metrics
* exports into **lightweight JS payloads**
* renders in a **static, portable WebGL + chart-based UI**

It is:

* self-contained
* composable
* reproducible
* safe for public and client-facing use

This architecture forms the backbone for many future POCs, demos, and applied AI experiments within the Qognus ecosystem.

# **Synthetic Data Generation Design — Qognus Demo Platform**

*ApexGrid Systems — Support Ticket Generation via Local LLMs (Ollama)*

---

## **1. Purpose & Scope**

This document describes how **synthetic enterprise support tickets** are generated for the fictional hybrid company **ApexGrid Systems** using **local LLMs via Ollama**.

Synthetic tickets serve as the foundation for:

* embeddings
* clustering
* topic extraction
* anomaly detection
* semantic search
* triage agent workflows
* WebGL visualization

The design ensures:

* high-quality, realistic enterprise data
* zero risk of real PII, customer names, or sensitive content
* consistent adherence to the ApexGrid taxonomy
* repeatability and controllability
* stable vocabulary for embedding clusters

---

# **2. Data Generation Goals**

Synthetic tickets must:

1. **Resemble real enterprise support cases**
2. **Use consistent domain vocabulary** from the product suite
3. **Respect the taxonomy** (category + subcategory)
4. **Produce natural cluster structure** for embeddings
5. **Include metadata** enabling charts & filters
6. **Avoid hallucinating real companies, people, or identifiable brands**
7. **Scale to 5,000–20,000 tickets** without quality collapse

---

# **3. Generation Pipeline Overview**

[Ollama Chat API]
    ↓
[JSON Validator]
    ↓
[Post-Processor / Normalizer]
    ↓
[data/raw/apexgrid_tickets.jsonl]
```

### Components:

* **Metadata Matrix**
  Pre-generated combinations of product, category, severity, etc.

* **Prompt Builder**
  Creates structured prompts for LLM ticket generation.

* **LLM (Ollama)**
  Local, deterministic-ish generation through system/user messages.

* **JSON Validator**
  Ensures well-formed JSON; re-requests if invalid.

* **Post-Processor**
  Applies cleanup, fixes inconsistencies, enforces taxonomy.

* **Output Writer**
  Appends JSON objects into `.jsonl` for downstream ML pipelines.

---

# **4. Models Used (via Ollama)**

Two local models are recommended:

### **4.1 Primary Ticket Generator**

* **Model:** `qwen2.5:latest` or `qwen2:latest`
* Why:

  * Best local LLM for structured, long-form enterprise text
  * Good JSON adherence
  * Clean domain language

### **4.2 Lightweight Alternative**

* **Model:** `llama3:8b` or `qwen:7b-instruct`
* Why:

  * Fast for generating large batches
  * Good JSON compliance with constrained prompts

---

# **5. Metadata Matrix Design**

Goal: generate diverse tickets while controlling distribution.

Structure (`metadata_matrix.csv` or generator):

| product     | category       | subcategory      | severity | customer_tier | region         | environment |
| ----------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| HelioCloud  | observability  | dashboard_error  | Sev3     | midmarket     | us-west-2      | production  |
| GridSense   | telemetry_drop | edge_offline     | Sev2     | enterprise    | eu-central-1   | production  |
| LineaOps    | integration    | PLC_driver_fault | Sev1     | enterprise    | us-east-1      | production  |
| VaultShield | authentication | MFA_failure      | Sev4     | startup       | ap-southeast-1 | staging     |
| ...         | ...            | ...              | ...      | ...           | ...            | ...         |

### Key Rules

* Respect product/domain alignment
* Severity distribution follows guidelines in `support_taxonomy.md`
* Ensure each product/category pair appears at least 100–300 times
* Generate 5–10k rows for robust manifold structure
* Metadata matrix drives ticket diversity, not randomness

---

# **6. Prompt Architecture**

Ticket generation uses **two-layer prompting**: a **system prompt** setting rules and a **user prompt** with metadata for a specific ticket.

---

## **6.1 System Prompt (Global Controls)**

```text
You are generating fully synthetic enterprise support tickets for a fictional company named ApexGrid Systems.

STRICT RULES:
- Never reference real companies, people, locations, or brands.
- Follow the ApexGrid Support Taxonomy exactly.
- Output ONLY valid JSON objects.
- Always include: ticket_id, timestamp, product, category, subcategory, severity, customer_tier, region, environment, channel, summary, description, topics.
- "description" should be 3-8 sentences.
- Use professional enterprise language.
- Do NOT include placeholder text.
- Use terminology consistent with the product domain (HelioCloud, GridSense, LineaOps, VaultShield).

The tickets represent common support issues across cloud observability, energy IoT, manufacturing robotics, and identity security analytics.
```

---

## **6.2 User Prompt (Per Ticket)**

```text
Generate ONE synthetic ApexGrid support ticket as JSON.

Use the following metadata exactly:

ticket_id: "{{ticket_id}}"
product: "{{product}}"
category: "{{category}}"
subcategory: "{{subcategory}}"
severity: "{{severity}}"
customer_tier: "{{customer_tier}}"
region: "{{region}}"
environment: "{{environment}}"
channel: "{{channel}}"

Focus the summary and description on the product domain and taxonomy definitions.
Include a list of short topic tags (2-4 items).
Timestamp should be within the last 30 days.
```

---

# **7. LLM Output Format**

Expected JSON object:

```json
{
  "ticket_id": "TCK-004381",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-12T03:21:44Z",
  "product": "HelioCloud",
  "category": "observability",
  "subcategory": "missing_log_stream",
  "severity": "Sev2",
  "customer_tier": "midmarket",
  "region": "us-west-2",
  "environment": "production",
  "channel": "portal",
  "summary": "Log stream for container group is missing from dashboard.",
  "description": "Our engineering team noticed missing logs from the main container group..."
  ,
  "topics": ["logs", "agent", "dashboard"]
}
```

---

# **8. JSON Validation and Retry Logic**

Tickets must pass validation before being accepted.

Validation checks:

1. JSON loads correctly
2. All required fields exist
3. Values comply with taxonomy
4. Summary is non-empty
5. Description ~3–8 sentences
6. Topics is a list
7. No real PII or unapproved proper nouns
8. No placeholder content (e.g., "lorem ipsum", "example.com")

### If any validation fails:

* Retry **up to 3 times** with a stricter corrective prompt
* Track failed items in logs

---

# **9. Post-Processing & Cleanup**

Performed after validation:

### **9.1 Normalization**

* Trim whitespace
* Canonicalize severity: `Sev1` vs `sev1`
* Convert region codes to canonical (`us-west-2`, etc.)
* Strip accidental real brand mentions (fallback filter)
* Ensure product-specific vocabulary appears

### **9.2 Content Quality Enhancements**

* Confirm summary is short (8–12 words)
* Confirm description uses product vocabulary
* Ensure no repetitive or duplicate text

### **9.3 Optional Augmentations**

* Automatically generate topics if missing (small term-frequency cluster)
* Add `triage_summary` using a compact LLM prompt
* Embed a sentence containing a measurable indicator (latency, voltage, throughput, etc.)

---

# **10. Ticket Volume & Batching**

Recommended volumes:

| Pipeline Purpose | Ticket Count | Notes                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Minimal demo     | 500–1,500    | Fast embeddings & UMAP                  |
| Standard demo    | 3,000–5,000  | Strong cluster density                  |
| Advanced         | 10,000+      | Best visual separation & topic clusters |

Batch strategy:

* Generate in chunks of 50–200 tickets
* Checkpoint after each batch
* Each batch receives a unique timestamp seed to avoid clustering artifacts

---

# **11. Determinism and Reproducibility**

To balance LLM creativity with repeatability:

* Set `temperature: 0.7–0.9` for richness
* For reproducibility experiments, use `temperature: 0.2–0.4`
* Persist the metadata matrix
* Persist all system and user prompts for audit
* Save each batch’s generation logs under `data/logs/`

---

# **12. Data Quality Management**

### **12.1 Linguistic Quality**

* Minimum sentence length check
* No contradictions with metadata
* Product vocabulary matching:
  e.g., GridSense → SCADA, sensors, voltage, telemetry

### **12.2 Taxonomy Alignment**

* Tickets must match allowed subcategories
* Cross-product mismatches are rejected:

  * e.g. VaultShield ticket containing `PLC_driver_fault` → invalid
* Category/subcategory pairs validated against `support_taxonomy.md`

### **12.3 Embedding Health Considerations**

* Avoid overly repetitive phrasing
* Ensure metadata distributions match guidelines
* Insert variation via minor stochasticity

---

# **13. Scalability Considerations**

### **13.1 Multi-threading**

Generation can be parallelized:

* One thread per metadata row
* Or batched parallel calls to Ollama
* Respect Ollama model loading constraints (usually 1 model active at a time)

### **13.2 Multi-Model Strategy**

To increase diversity:

* Mix models:

  * 70% `qwen2.5:latest`
  * 30% `llama3:8b`

### **13.3 Long-term Extension**

Future datasets may include:

* synthetic IoT telemetry
* synthetic identity access logs
* synthetic SCADA packets
* synthetic error traces
* synthetic call-center transcripts

All consistent with the same fictional organization.

    data = extract_json(resp.text)

    if not validate_ticket(data):
        return retry_with_correction(metadata)

    return clean_ticket(data)
```

---

# **16. Summary**

The synthetic data generation system:

* Uses **controlled metadata** to ensure domain diversity
* Uses **structured LLM prompts** to generate realistic text
* Enforces **taxonomy compliance** and vocabulary consistency
* Validates JSON and content quality
* Produces rich unified tickets across four domains
* Scales to thousands of samples
* Ensures clean semantic structure for embeddings & clustering
* Operates **100% locally** with **zero real data**

This system forms the beginning of the full ML pipeline documented in `ml_pipeline_design.md`.

## 3. Data Inputs & Outputs

### 3.1 Input: Synthetic Tickets

**Source:** `data/raw/apexgrid_tickets.jsonl` (or similar)

Each line contains a JSON object matching the **ApexGrid Support Ticket Schema**:

* `ticket_id`
* `timestamp`
* `product` (HelioCloud, GridSense, LineaOps, VaultShield)
* `category`, `subcategory`
* `severity` (Sev1–Sev4)
* `customer_tier`, `region`, `environment`
* `channel`
* `summary`, `description`
* optional `topics`

Tickets are generated via local models using **Ollama** (see `data_generation_design.md`).

### 3.2 Intermediate Outputs

* `data/processed/tickets.parquet` — normalized DataFrame
* `data/processed/embeddings.npy` — dense embedding matrix `[N x D]`
* `data/processed/ticket_meta.json` — metadata per ticket id
* `data/processed/manifold_3d.npy` — 3D projection `[N x 3]`
* `data/processed/cluster_labels.npy` — cluster ID per ticket
* `data/processed/model_health.json` — evaluation metrics

### 3.3 Web Artifacts

Under `web/data/`:

* `ticket_points.js`

  ```js
  window.TICKET_POINTS = {
    points: [
      {
        id: "TCK-000123",
        x: 0.23,
        y: -1.02,
        z: 1.84,
        product: "HelioCloud",
        category: "observability",
        severity: "Sev2",
        isP1: false,
        clusterId: 5
      },
      ...
    ]
  };
  ```

* `ticket_summary.js`

  ```js
  window.TICKET_SUMMARY = {
    numTickets: 10000,
    severityDistribution: { "Sev1": 0.03, "Sev2": 0.12, ... },
    categoryCounts: { "telemetry_drop": 1200, ... },
    clusterStats: {
      numClusters: 18,
      avgSilhouette: 0.42,
      largestClusterSize: 980,
      noiseFraction: 0.08
    }
  };
  ```

These are directly consumed by `index.html` and associated JS modules.

---

## 4. Synthetic Ticket Generation (Stage 1)

> Detailed prompting lives in `data_generation_design.md`; here we focus on pipeline integration.

**Implementation:** `synthetic/generate_tickets_ollama.py`

### 4.1 Responsibilities

* Call Ollama’s `/api/chat` with:

  * system prompt describing the schema and domain vocabulary
  * user prompt containing fixed metadata (product, severity, etc.)
* Decode and validate the JSON response
* Enforce compliance with taxonomy and schema
* Write tickets to JSONL, e.g.:

```json
{"ticket_id": "TCK-000001", "product": "HelioCloud", "category": "observability", ...}
```

### 4.2 Design Considerations

* Run in **batches** (e.g., 10–50 tickets at a time) for stability
* Validate `category`/`subcategory` against `support_taxonomy.md`
* Ensure no real companies or people are mentioned (prompt-level constraints)
* Keep `description` length manageable (3–8 sentences) to reduce embedding cost

---

## 5. Preprocessing & Normalization (Stage 2)

**Implementation:** `models/embed/compute_embeddings.py` (first half)

### 5.1 Steps

1. Read JSONL → `pandas.DataFrame`

2. Enforce schema:

   * missing fields filled with defaults
   * invalid categories dropped or mapped

3. Combine `summary` + `description` into a `text` field:

   ```python
   df["text"] = df["summary"].fillna("") + " " + df["description"].fillna("")
   ```

4. Normalize metadata values:

   * severity → `Sev1`, `Sev2`, …
   * region → canonical codes (`us-west-2`, etc.)
   * product → one of four known products

5. Optionally filter out extremely short or malformed tickets.

### 5.2 Outputs

* `tickets.parquet`
* `ticket_meta.json` containing ticket id → metadata mapping

---

## 6. Embedding Computation (Stage 3)

**Implementation:** `models/embed/compute_embeddings.py` (second half)
**Embedding models:** local via Ollama, e.g.:

* `mxbai-embed-large`
* `nomic-embed-text`

### 6.1 API Call Pattern

Embedding is done by hitting:

```python
def get_embedding(text: str) -> list[float]:
    resp = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings",
        json={"model": EMBED_MODEL, "prompt": text}
    )
    resp.raise_for_status()
    return resp.json()["embedding"]
```

### 6.2 Batch Strategy

* Iterate over `df["text"]`
* For each ticket:

  * compute embedding vector
  * append to an array
* Optionally checkpoint every N tickets

### 6.3 Post-processing

* Store embeddings as `numpy.ndarray` of shape `[N, D]`
* Save to `data/processed/embeddings.npy`
* Verify no NaNs; apply standardization (optional):

  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  scaler = StandardScaler()
  embeddings_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(embeddings)
  ```

---

## 7. Manifold Projection (Stage 4)

**Implementation:** `models/cluster/cluster_umap_hdbscan.py` (first part)

The goal here is to map high-dimensional embeddings into a **3D space** for WebGL, and optionally a 2D space for charts.

### 7.1 Algorithms

* Primary: **UMAP** (`umap-learn`)
* Alternative: **t-SNE** or PaCMAP for experimentation

Example (UMAP 3D):

```python
import umap
reducer = umap.UMAP(
    n_components=3,
    n_neighbors=30,
    min_dist=0.1,
    metric="cosine",
    random_state=42,
)
manifold_3d = reducer.fit_transform(embeddings_scaled)
```

### 7.2 Normalization for WebGL

After projection:

```python
max_abs = max(abs(manifold_3d).max(), 1e-6)
manifold_3d_norm = manifold_3d / max_abs * 3.0  # roughly within cube [-3, 3]^3
```

Save:

* `data/processed/manifold_3d.npy`

---

## 8. Clustering & Topic Extraction (Stage 5)

**Implementation:** `models/cluster/cluster_umap_hdbscan.py` (second part)

### 8.1 Clustering

Primary algorithm: **HDBSCAN**

```python
import hdbscan

clusterer = hdbscan.HDBSCAN(
    min_cluster_size=30,
    min_samples=10,
    metric="euclidean",
    cluster_selection_epsilon=0.05,
)
labels = clusterer.fit_predict(manifold_3d)
```

Characteristics:

* `labels[i] == -1` → noise / unassigned
* Remaining labels cluster tickets into semantically related groups

Save:

* `cluster_labels.npy`

### 8.2 Cluster Summaries & Topic Hints

For each cluster:

1. Collect all tickets with that label
2. Extract top keywords using TF–IDF or a simple term-frequency approach
3. Store representative words + counts

Optional: use an LLM to give each cluster a human-readable label:

```text
Cluster 5: "SCADA time synchronization drift across multiple substations."
Cluster 9: "VaultShield MFA false positives and throttling complaints."
```

Summaries stored into:

* `data/processed/cluster_summary.json`

---

## 9. Model Health & Evaluation Metrics (Stage 6)

**Implementation:** `models/eval/embedding_health.py`

The goal is to quantify the quality and behavior of the embedding + clustering.

### 9.1 Core Metrics

* **Silhouette Score**

  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
  valid_mask = labels != -1
  if valid_mask.sum() > 1:
      sil = silhouette_score(manifold_3d[valid_mask], labels[valid_mask])
  else:
      sil = None
  ```

* **Cluster Size Distribution**

  * Histogram of size per cluster
  * Fraction of points in noise

* **Category & Product Purity**

  * For each cluster, compute the distribution of:

    * `product`
    * `category`

* **Severity Distribution**

  * Weighted distribution across clusters
  * Fraction of Sev1 concentrated in particular clusters

### 9.2 Optional Retrieval Metrics

For duplicate or near-duplicate detection:

* Build approximate nearest neighbor index (e.g. FAISS or sklearn NearestNeighbors)
* Evaluate **precision@k** for retrieving tickets with identical (or similar) `category` + `subcategory`

Example:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=6, metric="cosine").fit(embeddings_scaled)
distances, indices = nn.kneighbors(embeddings_scaled)

## 10. Artifact Export for Web UI (Stage 7)

**Implementation:** usually part of clustering/eval scripts or a dedicated exporter, e.g. `models/eval/export_web_artifacts.py`.

### 10.1 ticket_points.js

Combine:

* `ticket_id`
* normalized 3D coordinates
* cluster label
* selected metadata fields

Example snippet:

```python
import json
import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path

def export_ticket_points(df, coords_3d, labels, out_path):
    points = []
    for i, row in df.iterrows():
        x, y, z = coords_3d[i].tolist()
        points.append({
            "id": row["ticket_id"],
            "x": float(x),
            "y": float(y),
            "z": float(z),
            "product": row["product"],
            "category": row["category"],
            "severity": row["severity"],
            "clusterId": int(labels[i]),
            "isP1": row["severity"] == "Sev1"
        })

    out = {
        "points": points
    }

    out_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    with out_path.open("w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write("window.TICKET_POINTS = ")
        json.dump(out, f)
        f.write(";\n")
```

### 10.2 ticket_summary.js

Aggregate high-level metrics + distributions for charts:

```python
summary = {
  "numTickets": int(len(df)),
  "severityDistribution": severity_dist,
  "categoryCounts": category_counts,
  "productCounts": product_counts,
  "clusterStats": {
    "numClusters": num_clusters,
    "avgSilhouette": sil,
    "noiseFraction": noise_fraction
  }
}
```

Write:

```python
with open("web/data/ticket_summary.js", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write("window.TICKET_SUMMARY = ")
    json.dump(summary, f)
    f.write(";\n")
```

---

## 11. Agentic & Triage Workflows (Stage 8 – Optional)

Beyond visualization, the same embedding + clustering setup can power **agent-style workflows**:

### 11.1 Triage Agent

* Inputs: new ticket text
* Steps:

  1. Embed the ticket
  2. Find nearest neighbors
  3. Infer likely category, severity, and product
  4. Propose:

     * suggested category/subcategory
     * similar past tickets
     * recommended resolution steps
  5. Optionally call an LLM to generate a triage summary

### 11.2 Incident Signature Detection

* Monitor cluster sizes over time
* Identify clusters whose ticket count spikes over a window (e.g., last 24/72 hours)
* Trigger a “potential incident” alert for that cluster

### 11.3 Integration with Web UI

* Provide an API or local endpoint that:

  * takes free-text
  * returns:

    * 3D location
    * nearest existing points
    * recommended cluster
    * triage suggestion

This can be demoed from the browser using a local backend.

---

## 12. Tech Stack Overview

### 12.1 Backend / ML

* **Python 3.x**
* `pandas` / `numpy`
* `scikit-learn` (UMAP, TSNE via separate package, metrics)
* `umap-learn`
* `hdbscan`
* `requests` (for Ollama calls)
* Optional: `faiss` or similar for ANN

### 12.2 Data & Artifacts

* JSONL for raw data
* Parquet / NPY / JSON for processed artifacts
* JS globals for web integration (no backend needed for demo)

### 12.3 Frontend

* **Three.js** for 3D scatterplot
* **TailwindCSS** for layout and styling
* **Chart.js** for charts
* **Vue.js (CDN)** for light state management
* `index.html` served via simple static hosting or `python -m http.server`

---

## 13. Operational Considerations

### 13.1 Batch vs. Real-Time

* The current design is **batch-oriented**:

  * Generate tickets
  * Recompute embeddings
  * Re-run manifold & clustering
  * Export web artifacts

* For real-time or incremental demos, lighter-weight incremental updates could be implemented (e.g., partial embedding + local re-clustering for new tickets), but this is out of scope for the initial design.

### 13.2 Reproducibility

* Fix random seeds:

  * UMAP / TSNE random state
  * HDBSCAN randomness, if applicable
* Version file formats and schema in documentation
* Optionally log runs (e.g., using MLflow or simple JSON run logs)

---

## 14. Summary

The Qognus Demo Platform’s ML pipeline for ApexGrid Systems:

* takes fully synthetic, LLM-generated support tickets
* converts them into dense embeddings suitable for

  * semantic search
  * clustering
  * visualization
* projects them into 3D for a **WebGL point cloud** that is:

  * semantically structured
  * visually compelling
  * easily explainable
* evaluates embedding and cluster quality with interpretable metrics
* exposes artifacts to a static frontend for demos, POCs, and workshops
* can be extended with triage agents, semantic search, and incident detection

This design makes ApexGrid an ideal synthetic “playground” for applied AI/ML in consulting, research, and product storytelling.

"""
generate_tickets_langchain.py
Qognus Demo Platform — ApexGrid Systems
---------------------------------------

Generates fully synthetic ApexGrid support tickets using a local LLM
via Ollama, with LangChain + Pydantic structured output.

Design:
1. Generate all metadata in Python (ticket_id, product, category, etc.)
2. Ask the LLM ONLY for:
   - summary
   - description
   - topics (list of tags)
3. Use LangChain's PydanticOutputParser to enforce structure.
4. Combine meta + generated body into a final ticket object.

Output:
- data/raw/apexgrid_tickets.jsonl

Each line is a JSON object with:
  ticket_id, timestamp, product, category, subcategory, severity,
  customer_tier, region, environment, channel, summary, description, topics

Idempotent behavior:
- If the JSONL already exists, we read it, find the max ticket index
  (from ticket_id like 'TCK-000123'), and append new tickets after that.
- If we already have >= TOTAL_TICKETS, the script exits without doing work.
