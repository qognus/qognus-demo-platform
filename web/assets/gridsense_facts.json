  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "How does GridSense distinguish between transient events and true anomalies?",
      "a": "GridSense applies temporal context and grace-period-aware scoring, allowing short-lived transients (such as switching operations) to decay without triggering alerts unless deviations persist or propagate across correlated signals."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is GridSense intended to replace SCADA systems?",
      "a": "No. GridSense complements existing SCADA infrastructure by providing higher-level analytics, anomaly detection, and fleet-wide insight without interfering with control systems."
    },
    {
      "q": "What data resolution does GridSense require?",
      "a": "GridSense supports input resolutions from sub-minute telemetry to 5-minute aggregates, with detection sensitivity adapting to the available sampling rate."
