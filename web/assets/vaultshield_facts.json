    {
      "q": "How does VaultShield differentiate between benign access changes and malicious behavior?",
      "a": "VaultShield evaluates identity events using temporal context, device familiarity, network reputation, and behavioral baselines, allowing expected changes to decay while highlighting sustained or correlated anomalies."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does VaultShield replace existing IAM or SSO providers?",
      "a": "No. VaultShield integrates with existing IAM and SSO systems to provide higher-level detection, correlation, and response guidance without replacing authoritative identity sources."

    {
      "q": "How are alerts prioritized for security teams?",
      "a": "Alerts are scored based on potential impact, confidence, and blast radius, enabling security teams to focus on high-risk events while suppressing low-confidence noise."
