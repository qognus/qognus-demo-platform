  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "How does LineaOps handle safety-critical systems?",
      "a": "LineaOps operates in an observational role only and does not issue control commands. Safety systems and interlocks remain authoritative within existing industrial control frameworks."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can LineaOps integrate with legacy PLCs?",
      "a": "Yes. LineaOps supports common industrial protocols and can ingest telemetry from legacy PLCs through gateways without requiring intrusive changes."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does LineaOps distinguish process drift from normal variability?",
      "a": "LineaOps models historical process variability and applies temporal context, allowing expected fluctuations to decay while highlighting sustained or correlated deviations."
